Questions
* Do we have to have 0-mean 1-std data as input to GP?
* Why does periodic kernel GP flatline with too much data?
* RBF + periodic: why is it flat on the edges?

ToDoâ€™s
* Start writing the report (Overleaf)
    * Mina: data
    * Hanbo: prediction models
    * Brady: Introduction to experiments
* Play around with the code (all of us)
    * Training data: up to cycle 23
    * Testing data: cycle 24
    * In the end: comparison with the 25th cycle prediction data
* Find answers to above questions (all of us)
