* Hanbo: architecture search with BIC
    * doesn't give better results than smk
    * tries to fit architectures with less parameters because of k
        * try without?

** Last ToDos **
(Mina)
- Multifidelity GP (optional)
    * not possible in GPytorch - try BoTorch or GPy?
- Lectoring writing

(Brady)
- some additional runs with different params (for example with/without error term)

Writing:
(Hanbo)
- kernel search
(Brady)
- methodology
- kernel intuitions

Rough outline:
methodology - GP introduction
    is warping necessary?
kernel intuitions - brief
    more detail on smk
fitting manually with smk and arbitrary num_mixtures
    criteria for evaluaton: likelihood, BIC, AIC...
kernel search logic
    tried BIC and log likelihoood
