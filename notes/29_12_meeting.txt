Questions
* Gaussian Processes on time series? - do some reading (all of us)
* Why does the GP work better on less data?
    * Just because of less noise?

ToDos
* How many periodic kernels were used in the Warped GP model? - Hanbo
* Look up how smoothed data are created - Mina
* Continue experimenting on kernels - Brady

(Brady) GP works better with
* white noise error kernel
* Less data (cycle min and max plus 5 random points inbetween)
* x axis numbered from 0 works better than 1755.0, 1755.01, … etc.

(Hanbo) Warped Gaussian Process model:
* Spectral density kernel - RBF times cosine kernel
* Predictions are non-negative
* Optimization w/ genetic algorithm
    * Kernel params
    * Number of kernels
    * “Warping function”: cubic spline
