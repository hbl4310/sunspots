#### Total and hemispheric sunspot numbers
Daily total and hemispheric sunspot numbers derived by the formula: R= Ns + 10 * Ng, with Ns the number of spots and Ng the number of groups counted either over the **entire solar disk** (total), the **North hemisphere** or **South hemisphere** (based on the sunspot group heliographic latitude).
